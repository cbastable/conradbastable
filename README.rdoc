== Conrad Bastable

Personal blog and general purpose site. Part-utility, part-testing ground.

Tentative plan is to work up to a full CMS. Not because there aren't enough CMSs out there, but because the exercise will teach me more about working with text and other parts of Rails I'm less comfortable with. Also because I want to.
